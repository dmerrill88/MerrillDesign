title:  "The Wonders of Illustrator"
---

I’ve been working with Adobe Creative Suite for a few months and it amazes me how much can be done with Adobe Illustrator in such a short time. Previously I had been using Adobe’s Photoshop to create everything from mockups to typographic discoveries to generating style tiles. With just a little practice Illustrator gives you the ability to do all sorts of things that I didn’t think could be done with such ease. 

Illustrator doesn’t only make it easer to do things, but there’s so many different things that can be done. Thinking off the top of my head just some of the things that I have been able to do include: wireframes, pixel perfect mockups, logo’s, icon’s, style tiles, user flows, use case, menu prototypes; I was even able to design a resume from scratch in Illustrator (I did’t feel like buying a template online) and it didn’t take all that much time. One more thing I wanted to add is how great Illustrator works with Typekit (another Adobe Creative Suite tools that focuses on typography).
