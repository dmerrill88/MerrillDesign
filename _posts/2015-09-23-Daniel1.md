title: "User Interface Design at The Iron Yard"
---

I have learned a lot in my first week and a half. I’ve already designed my first website and just leaned how to code CSS and HTML. I was sick a couple day’s, but even so I feel like I have a great handle on everything! I’m really enjoying the class and I can’t wait until I start interviewing for jobs.

Design is pretty different from developing IOS apps, but it’s gonna be great having the knowledge to do both. I have done an Iron Yard course before on mobile development and learned everything I needed to know to allow me to create IOS apps in Swift and Objective-C as well.
