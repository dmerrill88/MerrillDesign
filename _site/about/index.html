<p>I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a passionate developer and designer who likes to think outside the box to create new opportunities. After a few years in college where I was pursuing a degree in business, I realized that my true passion was for technology. I decided to take advantage of one of the top mobile development courses in the country at the Iron Yard. After finding success following the Iron Yard, I elected to take a second intensive course in design a year later. Having the ability to understand both design and development is a unique trait. It allows you to bridge the gap between misunderstandings that designers and developers seem to consistently have.</p>

<p>By 2015, I was interested in experiencing life in a different city. My decision was made easy when I visited Austin Texas. Shortly after my visit I decided to take the leap and move.</p>

<p>Since my journey into technology I have been freelancing, tech consulting, and in the last year started my own company.</p>
