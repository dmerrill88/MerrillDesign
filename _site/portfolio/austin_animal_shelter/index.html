			<h2> The Project </h2>
			<p> 
			Shelter App was created to be a rapid prototype of what a native mobile app would look like and how it would be used. Two other designers and I made this app and prototyped it in a weekend. We designed all the screens and user flows from scratch, then used InVision to prototype the app's functionality.</p>

		<h3>Problem:</h3>
		<p class="project-body important-text"> 
		People who volunteer to foster animals from shelter’s often have jobs and other things that keep them busy. Most times, these foster parents can’t get out of certain obligations to take their pet in to the clinic for appointments or to various adoption events on weekends. However other volunteers working at the shelter are available take these pets to different appointments, but unfortunately don’t have time to foster a pet full time. At the moment the shelter has to act as a middleman to connect foster parents with volunteers who can help out from time to time.
		</p>
		<h3>The Solution:</h3>
		<p class="project-body important-text">
		So the other designers and I put our heads together and came up with an idea for an app that is designed to effortlessly connect foster parents and volunteers for pet rides. We implemented an Uber-like system of ride requests to streamline and simplify the ride-giving process, and we found a way to make it more exciting for all of the parties involved.
		</p>
		<h3>And so it began</h3>
		<p class="project-body">
		To find inspiration I began to research other apps that had the functionality I was looking for to create the Shelter App. Then went on to look at various mobile screens, sizes, and common layouts. 
		</p>
		<h3>The pictures posted below are the Wordlist and Sitemap for the project. </h3>

		After deciding on the functionality of the app it was time to move on to style tiles and sketches. Below are a few sketches and style tiles for the app.

	After drawing all sketches for each screen it was time to start wireframing, then on to the Mockups. It was fun designing the screens, buttons, and typography with the other designers.

		Lastly I learned InVision to create a prototype that could be tangibly used. 
		Feel free to play around with part of the volunteer side of the app below!
