## Hi, I'm Daniel

I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. After majoring in Business at the University of Mississippi, I came back home to hunt for a job, but wasn’t finding options that I felt really passionate about. I then decided to take a Mobile Development intensive immersion program at The Iron Yard. While there, I learned everything about creating native IOS apps. Shortly after completing the program, I began freelancing. 

By 2015, I wanted to find a more permanent job and was also interested in experiencing life in a different city. My decision on a city was made easy when I discovered a new addition to The Iron Yard’s curriculum, called the User Interface Design program which was located in Austin Texas.
