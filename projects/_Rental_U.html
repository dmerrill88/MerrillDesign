			<h2> The Project </h2>
			<p> 
			Rental U is a conceptual native-application that I designed from scratch in Adobe Illustrator. It is designed to act as a virtual apartment locator service that allows it’s users to find apartments and allows them to book tours of these apartments with just a few clicks. I created everything from the inception of the idea to the final interactive prototype created with Pixate. This project will showcase my ability to do just about every UI/UX process involved in creating a mobile app from start of a project to the beginning of development phases for a mobile app.</p>

			<h2> The Research </h2>
		</div>
		<p class="project-body"> 
		Since doing my redesign of Goodreads they have redesigned their site themselves. Although it’s much better now it was a disaster when I decided to take on the project. My first experience with good reads wasn’t a great one. The colors, typography, and navigation of the site were all a problem. After signing into the site I started exploring. I added books I had read, rated books, used my cellphone, and created bookshelves.
		</p>
		<p class="project-body important-text">
		I realized that the site is very helpful. It keeps track of books I'm reading, helps me quickly scan lists of books I have read or want to read, and shows me what my friends are currently reading as well. However navigating through the site was anything but intuitive. From a usability standpoint, the current Goodreads site is awful. Even after days of carefully using the site, I still found myself confused or lost. Features are duplicated and overcomplicated, and a general lack of hierarchy makes every conceivable action equally important.

			<h2> User Personas and Senarios</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="project-body">
		I created three user personas and senarios. Each representing a different type of GoodReads' user, and all users having a unique set of values and goals.

			<h2>Style Tiles</h2>
		</div>
		<p class="project-body">
		For the project, I wanted to create three totally different styles to see what range of feelings I could get from each. I ended up taking ideas from each of the tiles and  combined them to create one ultimate mockup. I took the colors from style tile 1, the design patterns from stile tile 2, and the typography of stile tile 3.

		<h2> The Final Mockups </h2>
	</div>
	<p class="project-body">
	After deciding on my stylistic direction and sketching the different screens and sizes, I began the final part of the project: pixel-perfect mockups.<br>
	Pixel-perfect mockups include everything from padding, to fonts, colors to image sizes, buttons, and icons. Below, are the mockups for 3 pages in a mobile and regular browser size.
